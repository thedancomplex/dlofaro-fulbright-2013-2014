Fulbright Statement of Grant Purpose: Project Proposal\\
\large
Daniel M. Lofaro, Croatia\\
Topic: Mobile Manipulator Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (MM-UAV) and Robotics\\
Title: Mobile Manipulator Unmanned Aerial Vehicles for Mine Removal\\

\end{center}

\normalsize
Demining, or mine removal, is a critical ongoing effort in the Republic of Croatia.  The Croatian Mine 
Action Centre (CROMAC), Croatia's leading organization for demining operations, has a publicly stated 
mission of "performing testing, research, development and education in the field of mine action in the 
Republic of Croatia."  My proposed Fulbright work focuses on the research and development portion 
the CROMAC mission statement.  I propose to create a flying vehicle (Mobile Manipulator Unmanned 
Aerial Vehicle: MM-UAV) that can manipulate the environment and demine via the use of attached 
arms/manipulators.  This will be done in conjunction with Dr. Kovacic Zdenko and Dr. Bogdan Stjepan 
at the LARICS lab at the University of Zagreb in Croatia.  This will show that MM-UAVs have the ability 
to perform dexterous and delicate tasks that are dangerous to humans, specifically preforming 
demining operations.

\section{Intro}
Talk about CROMAC and what the project is, i.e. flying vehicles with arms (keep to about 4 sentences)
Unmanned Aerial Vehicles, or UAVs, have become a common place in the world economy


\section{Research Background}
Talk about how it is a new and blossiming field.  Idea comes from starwars probe droids (keep to about 
6 sentences)

\section{Proposal}
I propose on creating a MM-UAV system that is capable of flying in autonomous and semi-autonomous 
modes.  The MM-UAV will have decorous arms capable of manipulating the environment.  The arms 
will be attached to a rotocraft capable of hovering, either standard helicopter with tail prop, coaxial 
helicopter, or multi rotor helicopter (such as quadro or hex copters).  The specific helicopter will be 
denoted by the required payload and size needed.  Multiple rotocraft are available at LARICS for use 
with this project.  The brains of the machine will consist of a linux enabled micro controller allowing for 
a large amount of open source software to be run on it.  The arms will be made out of standard off the 
shelf servo motors and custom designed parts printed on the rapid prototyping machine available at 
the LARICS Lab.  This first stage will take approximately 3 months including the startup time in the lab.  
The next three months will be spent on modifying existing control algorithms to allow the mm-uav to 
maintain stable flight.  during this time multiple iterations of arm configuration and placement will be 
modeled tested and verified.  At the end of the second three months a final version of the hardware and 
control algorithms will be ready.  the final three months will be spent using the robot in simulated real 
world tests such as demeaning operations, IED removal etc.  due to the highly research oriented se on 
real land minds and IEDs will not be attempted during the fulbright stint.  In result there will be a 
minimum of two publications written on the topic, one in the hardware design of the system and one on 
the control system, as well as multiple videos available for public viewing.  as a part of my typical 
outreach I will have public demonstrations of the device in my ongoing attempt to increase 
exceptement about science and technology.  

\section{Previous Collaberation}
work before with NATO-ASI on unmanned systems which lead to a fulbright student coming to our lab 
to work with us on UAVs with arms, now the next obvious step is for me to go and continue the work at 
their institution (4 sentences)

\section{Language}
Is very farmiliar with how well the lab can speek english so will not have a problem however will take 
language classes when attending (keep to 2 sentences)

\section{How will help the USA and Croatia}
helps the ongoing world effort to demine Croatia.  I have also helped orginize multiple conferences in 
the past and will work with Zdenko and Bogdan with orginizing other local/international conference, 
this will help becasue I am a native english speaker and engineering conferences are done in english. 
(3 sentences)

\section{Host contries relation to topic}
LARICS works with quadrotor UAV's and has been workign with DASL to put arms on them since 2011 
(2 sentences)

\section{what is my relation/experence}
eas statend in personal statement, I work with complex autonomous systems and stability.  I am 
extencively farmiliar with how the motion of massive objects such as arms effect the stability of a system 
(dissertation topic).  Masters in control systems  (4 sentences)

\section{Misc.}
\begin{itemize}
\item it can be done in 8 to 10 months because it has been started
\item i can do it with my current ability
\item we are doing the pioneering work in this area.
\end{itemize}

\section{compelling and effects to USA}
explian how is compelling and that it brings our expertease of UAVs from the USA to Croatia for a 
nobile purpose of demining.  increases the ability of the USA to help the world and also creates 
technology that can be used for other jobs important to the USA such as IED disarming and purching 
survaliance (4 sentences)

\section{how will help correer} 
this will help correer by increasing my network and collabrators (of which i already have many)  the 
stregthened relationship will allow for furthre work and open doors for post-dock position and future 
collaberation in accademia (my desired vocation).  (4 sentences)

\section{social impact}
socially i will express my gratitude with my knowledge of american culture and explore Croatian culture 
through food and photography (my hobby)

\section{mutual understanding}
usa gets the pride of helping others with the fixing an important problem and croatia helps push the 
technology for the usa in the bloomign field of MM-UAV (2 sentences)

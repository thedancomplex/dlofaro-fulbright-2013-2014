Fulbright Statement of Grant Purpose: Project Proposal\\
\large
Daniel M. Lofaro, Croatia\\
Topic: Mobile Manipulator Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (MM-UAV) and Robotics\\
Title: Mobile Manipulator Unmanned Aerial Vehicles for Mine Removal\\

\end{center}

\normalsize
Demining, or mine removal, is a critical ongoing effort in the Republic of Croatia.  The Croatian Mine Action Centre (CROMAC), Croatia's leading organization for demining operations, has a publicly stated mission of "performing testing, research, development and education in the field of mine action in the Republic of Croatia."  My proposed Fulbright work focuses on the research and development portion the CROMAC mission statement.  I propose to create a flying vehicle (Mobile Manipulator Unmanned Aerial Vehicle: MM-UAV) that can manipulate the environment and demine via the use of attached arms/manipulators.  This will be done in conjunction with Dr. Kovacic Zdenko and Dr. Bogdan Stjepan at the LARICS lab at the University of Zagreb in Croatia.  This will show that MM-UAVs have the ability to perform dexterous and delicate tasks that are dangerous to humans, specifically preforming demining operations.

\section{Intro}
Talk about CROMAC and what the project is, i.e. flying vehicles with arms (keep to about 4 sentences)

\section{Research Background}
Talk about how it is a new and blossiming field.  Idea comes from starwars probe droids (keep to about 6 sentences)

\section{Previous Collaberation}
work before with NATO-ASI on unmanned systems which lead to a fulbright student coming to our lab to work with us on UAVs with arms, now the next obvious step is for me to go and continue the work at their institution (4 sentences)

\section{Language}
Is very farmiliar with how well the lab can speek english so will not have a problem however will take language classes when attending (keep to 2 sentences)

\section{How will help the USA and Croatia}
helps the ongoing world effort to demine Croatia.  I have also helped orginize multiple conferences in the past and will work with Zdenko and Bogdan with orginizing other local/international conference, this will help becasue I am a native english speaker and engineering conferences are done in english. (3 sentences)

\section{Host contries relation to topic}
LARICS works with quadrotor UAV's and has been workign with DASL to put arms on them since 2011 (2 sentences)

\section{what is my relation/experence}
eas statend in personal statement, I work with complex autonomous systems and stability.  I am extencively farmiliar with how the motion of massive objects such as arms effect the stability of a system (dissertation topic).  Masters in control systems  (4 sentences)

\section{Misc.}
\begin{itemize}
\item it can be done in 8 to 10 months because it has been started
\item i can do it with my current ability
\item we are doing the pioneering work in this area.
\end{itemize}

\section{compelling and effects to USA}
explian how is compelling and that it brings our expertease of UAVs from the USA to Croatia for a nobile purpose of demining.  increases the ability of the USA to help the world and also creates technology that can be used for other jobs important to the USA such as IED disarming and purching survaliance (4 sentences)

\section{how will help correer} 
this will help correer by increasing my network and collabrators (of which i already have many)  the stregthened relationship will allow for furthre work and open doors for post-dock position and future collaberation in accademia (my desired vocation).  (4 sentences)

\section{social impact}
socially i will express my gratitude with my knowledge of american culture and explore Croatian culture through food and photography (my hobby)

\section{mutual understanding}
usa gets the pride of helping others with the fixing an important problem and croatia helps push the technology for the usa in the bloomign field of MM-UAV (2 sentences)
